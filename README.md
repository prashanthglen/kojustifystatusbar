# Justify KOReader Status bar

This is my attempt to distribute all the items in the KOReader status bar to be spread apart across the width of the device and be equally spaced.

## Patch
Things I still want to add on to the patch:

- [x] Progress bar.
- [x] Select items to display from the settings (for footer only).
- [x] Implement more than 3 dynamic spaces.
- [ ] Implement grouping together of status bar items.

## Usage
1. Download the ![file](./2-justified-status_bar.lua).
1. Move this patch over to the `koreader/patches` folder.
1. Restart KOReader.
